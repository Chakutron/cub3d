## What the project does: ##
The cub3D project is a 3D graphics program that uses ray-casting to create a first-person perspective within a maze, inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. It allows the player to navigate through the maze while rendering walls, textures, and player movement.

## Why the project is useful: ##
This project is useful because it introduces the fundamentals of ray-casting, a key technique in computer graphics. It enhances skills in C programming, mathematics, and working with graphical libraries like MiniLibX, providing a deeper understanding of how early 3D games functioned.
